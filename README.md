# ---  README for Ray Session  ---

Ray Session is a GNU/Linux session manager for audio programs as Ardour, Carla, QTractor, Non-Timeline, etc...<br>
It uses the same API as Non Session Manager, so programs compatible with NSM are also compatible with Ray Session.<br>
As Non Session Manager, the principle is to load together audio programs, then be able to save or close all documents together.<br>

Ray Session offers a little more:

* Factory templates for NSM and LASH compatible applications
* Possibility to save any client as template
* Save session as template
* Name files with a prettier way
* remember if client was started or not
* Abort session allmost anytime
* Change Main Folder of sessions on GUI
* Possibility to KILL client if clean exit is too long
* Open Session Folder button (open default file manager)

You can see documentation on NSM at: http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Session%20Manager

Ray Session is being developed by houston4444, using Python3 and Qt5.
