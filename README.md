# ---  README for Ray Session  ---

Ray Session is an alternative to Non-Session-Manager.
It's a GNU/Linux session manager for audio programs as Ardour, Carla, QTractor, Non-Timeline, etc...

It uses the same API as Non Session Manager, so programs compatible with NSM are also compatible with Ray Session.

As Non Session Manager, the principle is to load together audio programs, then be able to save or close all documents together.

Ray Session offers a little more:
    More beautiful client paths
    remember if client was started or not
    Abort session almost anytime
    Change Main Folder of sessions on GUI
    Possibily to KILL client if clean exit is too long
    Open Session Folder button (open default file manager)

You can see documentation on NSM at: http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Session%20Manager

Ray Session is being developed by houston4444, using Python3 and Qt5.
