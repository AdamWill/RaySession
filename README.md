# ---  README for Ray Session  ---

Ray Session is an alternative to Non-Session-Manager.
It's a session manager for audio programs as Ardour, Carla, QTractor, Non-Timeline, etc...

It uses the same API, so, programs compatible with NSM are also compatible with RaySession.


You can see documentation on NSM at: http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Session%20Manager

Ray Session is being developed by houston4444, using Python3 and Qt5.
