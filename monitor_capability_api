when a client informs NSM server it has ':monitor:' capability
server sends to it one following message per existing client.

/nsm/client/monitor/client_state s:client_id i:is_started

where 'is_started' is set to 1 if client is started, else 0

This message is sent just before to send it the /nsm/client/open message.

at each event, this monitor client will receive

/nsm/client/monitor/client_event s:client_id s:event

where 'event' can be

client_started
client_joined
client_ready
client_saved
client_stopped_by_server
client_stopped_by_itself
client_removed
client_open_error
client_save_error
client_start_request
client_save_request
client_stop_request

'client_joined' event happens when client is joined to the session
from external, starting it with NSM_URL=server_url client_executable

in RaySession, 'client_removed' event happens when a client
is definitely removed from the trash.

Note that a monitor client doesn't receives /nsm/client/monitor_event if the event
concerns this monitor client.
